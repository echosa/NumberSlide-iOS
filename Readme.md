This is a number slide game I've written to learn iOS developement and XCode.

I wrote the initial working version of the game in less time than a typical 8-hour work day (not in one sitting, but throughout the course of a single day). This includes reading up on Objective-C and XCode basics.

I plan on working more with this project. I want to try to get it working in landscape also (its just portait currently) as well as get an iPad version working. I'll probably do some other things to it as well. After all, this is mostly a learning experience for me.

Keep in mind that this app will not be hitting the App Store. You have to have a paid developer account for that, which I don't have.
